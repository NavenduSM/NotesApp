# Notes App Backend (MERN)

This is the backend for a **Notes App** built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT authentication**.  
Users can register, log in, logout, reset-password, and create personal notes that are linked to their accounts.  
Only the authenticated user can access, update, or delete their own notes.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- User registration and login with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- Forgot password & reset password with email support
- Secure logout (JWT cookie cleared on client)
- JWT-based authentication with cookies
- CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Each note is linked to a specific user
- Error handling and secure routes
- Ready for frontend integration (React / Next.js)

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Authentication**: JWT, bcrypt
- **Email (optional)**: Nodemailer (for verification/reset)
